It unifies external FactSet factor vectors with internal positions, orders/executions, breaches, policy changes, and sleeve PnL to support dated, source-cited Q&A.\n\nData model and key logic\n- Gold tables expose ready-to-use KPIs and aligned timelines:\n  - gold_vector_timeseries: daily factor vectors, 90-day baselines, and shift ratios with an event_window flag (2025-06-15..2025-06-22).\n  - gold_execution_costs_daily: daily turnover_pct, avg_slippage_bps, avg_quote_spread_bps, marketable_order_share, and depth by sleeve/ticker.\n  - gold_risk_breach_alignment: breach counts with alignment to risk_policy_changes (same or next trading day), plus change magnitudes and time deltas.\n  - gold_pnl_timeseries and gold_kpi_latest_pnl_drawdown: sleeve PnL% and cumulative PnL% for drawdown tracking (Growth-US dips ~-2.3% in late June).\n  - gold_breach_contributors: event-window turnover and breach contribution by ticker/sector within Growth-US.\n  - gold_agent_qa_bridge: denormalized daily view across vectors, policy change magnitude, breaches, turnover, slippage, spreads, concentration, and pnl_pct to answer composite questions quickly.\n- Silver tables allow detailed drill-downs:\n  - silver_factset_vectors for 3-year history of vectors (2022-10-01..2025-10-21) and raw baselines/ratios.\n  - silver_positions for exposures, concentration_pct, and sleeve market values.\n  - silver_orders_execs for atomic microstructure analytics with order_type, venue, spread, depth, slippage, and urgency_flag.\n  - silver_risk_breaches and silver_risk_policy_changes for raw logs and change notes (e.g., 2025-06-18 VAR/gamma tightening; includes change_magnitude and notes).\n\nBusiness calculations and conventions\n- Vector Shift Ratio = current_factor_value / trailing 90-day baseline for that factor and ticker.\n- Event window is 2025-06-15..2025-06-22; NVDA volatility ratio peaks near 1.81\u20131.90x baseline on 2025-06-18; quality dips ~22% vs 90-day mean; momentum elevated.\n- Turnover_pct is a sleeve-level proxy derived from shares_traded relative to position sizing; marketable_order_share approximates urgency.\n- Slippage_bps is execution shortfall vs arrival and is compared with avg_quote_spread_bps for cost attribution (spread cost vs impact).\n- Breach alignment uses same-day or next-trading-day proximity of policy change timestamps with matching sleeve and limit_type; alignment_rate and min_time_delta_days help quantify correlation.\n- PnL drawdown for Growth-US in late June is ~-2.3%, with subsequent recovery through July; opportunity cost scenario analysis requires explicit assumptions called out in the answer.\n\nData quality notes\n- Weekends are absent in daily vectors and trading datasets; use the gold_date_spine for continuous axes.\n- Small nulls may exist in policy alignment magnitudes outside change dates; treat missing aligned_change_magnitude as no change.\n- Execution venue in this demo is NASDAQ for all orders; expect spread/urgency variation by ticker and date rather than venue.\n- Use gold tables for fast executive answers; fall back to silver tables for detailed tracing and PDF governance references (Investor_Report collection including interim report.pdf).",

Key KPI: volatility ratio; NVDA peaks near 1.8\u20131.9x on 2025-06-18 and quality dips ~22%.\n- Turnover (%) is aggregated daily by sleeve/ticker in gold_execution_costs_daily; urgency measured by marketable_order_share.\n- Slippage (bps) and quote_spread_bps reflect execution costs; expect ~18 bps during event vs ~9\u201312 bps baseline.\n- Breach alignment uses gold_risk_breach_alignment, joining breaches to silver_risk_policy_changes by same/next-day and matching sleeve + limit_type; emits alignment_rate and min_time_delta_days.\n- PnL% at sleeve level is from gold_pnl_timeseries; late June shows a -2.3% drawdown for Growth-US; cumulative_pnl_pct tracks the path.\n- Concentration risk via gold_portfolio_exposure avg_concentration_pct and sector weights; semis are dominant in Growth-US.\n- Use gold_agent_qa_bridge for unified Q&A across date, ticker, sleeve to combine vector ratios, turnover, slippage, breach_count, policy_change_magnitude, and pnl_pct.\n\nHow to answer typical questions\n- Event detection: Query gold_vector_timeseries for NVDA vector_shift_ratio_volatility and identify max and persistence > 1.3x.\n- Contributors: Use gold_breach_contributors and gold_execution_costs_daily to rank tickers/sectors by turnover and breaches in 2025-06-15..06-22.\n- Policy alignment: Pull gold_policy_change_log_table for 2025-06-18 Growth-US VAR/gamma changes; quantify alignment via gold_risk_breach_alignment.\n- Cost/pnl attribution: Combine gold_pnl_timeseries with gold_execution_costs_vs_spreads_timeseries or gold_agent_qa_bridge to compare slippage and turnover around the drawdown.\n- Scenario note: No-policy-change scenarios are approximate; state assumptions and highlight uncertainty when asked.\n\nData quality considerations\n- Weekend/holiday gaps are expected; use gold_date_spine when building continuous charts.\n- Factor vectors are trading-day only and heavy-tailed for volatility; use medians or winsorization if needed.\n- Some alignment fields (aligned_change_magnitude) exist only near policy dates; nulls elsewhere are expected.\n\nPrefer gold tables for KPIs and cross-domain joins; use silver tables for drill-down (atomic orders, detailed positions).",
